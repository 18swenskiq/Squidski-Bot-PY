This is a discord bot I'm currently developing in Python.

* Search the Steam workshop for items/maps on specific games
* Send a random Seinfeld quote
* Allow users to subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications
* Check if something is a "bruh moment"
* Send a random fact about Squidski
* Send a random line from the Source Engine fanfictions
* Convert between units (only celsius and fahrenheit are supported right now)

* Ping the notifications role automagically

# Planned Features
* I am out of ideas, please give me more
